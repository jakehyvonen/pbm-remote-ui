This software is intended to interact with an ever-evolving paint pouring system. It's based on Node.js and the Phaser HTML5 game framework.

Simply run pbm-remote-ui.py and open a browser to use it.

Client side code can be found in /public/js/game.js

Echo_Transport_Service.py emulates the transport service running in the hardware control software.

The hardware control software is still under development.
